# EDCOP-Kubernetes
Within this repository lies the YAML files of our EDCOP applications for Kubernetes. Each service should run within Kubernetes, NOT directly in the native Docker environment. Please consult the configuration guides for steps on how to use these files within Kubernetes.

*Note: Each of these YAML files are intended to be used with Kubernetes and have only been tested utilizing Rancher as a Kubernetes deployment solution. Our use case is dependent on in-house hardware, NOT cloud services.*
